# Quiz: Using Truth Values of Objects
# The code below is the solution to the Which Prize quiz you've seen previously. You're going to rewrite this based on what you've learned about truth values.

# points = 174

# if points <= 50:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a wooden rabbit!"
# elif points <= 150:
#     result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."
# elif points <= 180:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a wafer-thin mint!"
# else:
#     result = "Congratulations! You won a penguin!"

# print(result)
# You will use a new variable prize to store a prize name if one was won, and then use the truth value of this variable to compose the result message. This will involve two if statements.

# 1st conditional statement: update prize to the correct prize name based on points.
# 2nd conditional statement: set result to the correct phrase based on whether prize is evaluated as True or False.

# If prize is None, result should be set to "Oh dear, no prize this time."
# If prize contains a prize name, result should be set to "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize). This will avoid having the multiple result assignments for different prizes.
# At the beginning of your code, set prize to None, as the default value.

points = 174  # use this as input for your submission

# establish the default prize value to None
prize = None

# use the points value to assign prizes to the correct prize names
if points <= 50:
    prize = "wooden rabbit"
elif 151 <= points <= 180:
    prize = "wafer-thin mint"
elif points >= 181:
    prize = "penguin"

# use the truth value of prize to assign result to the correct prize
if prize:
    result = "Congratulations! You won a {}!".format(prize)
else:
    result = "Oh dear, no prize this time."

print(result)
